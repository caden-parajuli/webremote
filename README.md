# WebRemote

> [!CAUTION]
> This is in extremely early stages. Do not use this for *any* purpose.

WebRemote is just what it sounds like, a web-based remote. The vision is for you
to be able to control a Wayland-based Home Theater PC with a PWA on your phone.
The goal is to obtain a "smart TV"-like experience.

Currently it is very early stages. I will be first making it work for my particular
setup, then I will add configurability and make it more general-purpose. I do want
this to eventually be something anyone can use, but for now my priority is just
hacking something together that works for me.

If you're interested in the vision of this project, don't hesitate to reach out.
